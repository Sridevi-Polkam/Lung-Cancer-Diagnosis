# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Analysis
## **🚀 Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis Dashboard**

## **📖 Overview**

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the Lung Cancer Dataset, which contains patient demographic, medical, and lifestyle data. The dashboard is designed to analyze risk factors, study trends, and provide insights into lung cancer prevalence, treatment, and survival outcomes.


The dashboard is divided into three pages:

Lung Cancer Overview – High-level summary of cases, demographics, smoking impact, and mortality.

Smoking & Risk Factors – Focused analysis on smoking, passive smoking, and environmental exposures.

Treatment & Survival Analysis – Insights into treatment effectiveness, survival years, and mortality trends.




## **🗂 Dataset**

The dataset includes:

Demographics: Age, gender, and country

Lifestyle & Environment: Smoking, passive smoking, and air pollution exposure

Genetic & Medical Data: Genetic risk, cancer stage, treatment type

Outcomes: Diagnosis status, survival years, mortality rate, and risk scores



## **🛠 Tools & Technologies**

Power BI – For data cleaning, dashboard creation & visualization

Excel / CSV – For initial data cleaning 

DAX – For custom KPI measures (risk scores, survival rates, mortality rates)




## **📊 Dashboard Pages**

🔹 Page 1: Lung Cancer Overview

KPIs: Total cases, average age, smoker % with cancer, mortality rate

Visuals: Cases by country & gender, age distribution, smoking impact score, mortality vs. air pollution, risk score distribution

🔹 Page 2: Smoking & Risk Factors

KPIs: Total smokers, average smoking years, high-risk patients, early detection rate

Visuals: Smoking vs. cancer cases, years smoked vs. cancer stage, passive smoking impact, smoking & air pollution relationship, early detection by stage

🔹 Page 3: Treatment & Survival Analysis

KPIs: Average survival years, annual deaths, prevalence rate, survival rate by early detection

Visuals: Survival by treatment type, deaths by country, developed vs. developing prevalence, mortality by treatment, survival distribution by stage & gender



## **📌 Problem Statement**

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, often diagnosed at late stages due to limited awareness and delayed screening. Identifying high-risk individuals and analyzing contributing factors such as smoking, passive smoking, air pollution, and genetic predispositions is critical for early detection and effective treatment planning. However, healthcare professionals and researchers often face challenges in integrating demographic, lifestyle, genetic, and clinical data into a single platform that provides actionable insights.

To address this gap, an interactive dashboard is required to visualize and analyze patient records, highlight key risk factors, monitor mortality and survival trends, and support decision-making for early detection and treatment strategies.



## **🎯 Project Objectives**

1. Lung Cancer Trends Analysis

   Track total lung cancer cases, prevalence rates, and demographic distributions (age, gender, country).

   Identify patterns in smoking, passive smoking, and environmental exposure as risk contributors.

2. Risk Factor Evaluation

   Compare smoking impact, years of smoking, and air pollution exposure against cancer diagnosis and progression.

   Highlight high-risk patients using computed risk scores and early detection indicators.

3. Treatment & Survival Insights

   Analyze survival years and survival rates across different treatment types and cancer stages.

   Assess mortality trends across countries and between developed vs. developing regions.




## **🔍 Key Insights**

🔹**Page 1: Lung Cancer Overview**

Smokers make up a significant share of lung cancer patients, confirming smoking as the strongest risk factor.

Mortality rates rise with higher air pollution exposure, highlighting environmental risk.

Males show higher lung cancer prevalence than females, but females with high-risk scores are increasing.

Average age of patients clusters around middle to older age groups (45–65 years).


🔹**Page 2: Smoking & Risk Factors**

Years of smoking strongly correlate with cancer stage progression, showing cumulative damage impact.

Passive smoking also contributes to lung cancer cases, particularly in younger age groups.

Patients exposed to both smoking and air pollution show significantly higher risk scores.

Early detection rate remains low, suggesting a gap in screening and preventive healthcare.


🔹**Page 3: Treatment & Survival Analysis**

Average survival years improve with early detection and timely treatment.

Targeted therapies show higher survival rates compared to conventional treatments.

Developed countries report higher prevalence but better survival rates, while developing nations struggle with higher mortality.

Late-stage cancer patients have a steep decline in survival years, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis.
